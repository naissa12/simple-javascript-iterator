========
Please see JS folder for simple Javascript Iterator.

The index.html file outputs to the console and does the following:
- Shows the output of iterating through an array. The numbers in the array are the same numbers in the first div with class name, "section".
- Calls iterator.tag(). The tagged value is equal to the value in the array the iterator pointed to before the iterator.tag() function was called.
- Call iterator.reverse(). The value in the array that the iterator points to is the same before and after calling iterator.reverse()).

Question
=========

Describe your favorite feature in your favorite website or application. What is it about this feature that makes it important to you? What are some things that make this feature unique? What is something you don't like about this feature? How would you improve this?

Answer
============

My favorite feature is GMail's Task List feature. It improves my productivity by helping me keep track of my todo list.

The feature is unique because it is present inside of Gmail and most of the tasks that I need to complete result from emails I  receive. For example, a few days ago I received an email that made me think of a task that I needed to complete. By simply clicking on the task button in Gmail, I was able to add the task to my to-do list.

Unfortunately, the GMail's Task List feature does not allow me to specify my progress for each task. If I were to redesign the feature, I would allow users to track their progress for each task. Clicking on a task would show a page where users can specify milestones for each task. The page would display graphs and text, allowing the user to track the completion of each milestone.
